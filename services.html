           <h3>Waste Management</h3>
           <p>Prakash industries participates in all type of dealings of plastic waste products such as plastic bottles, plastic bags, beverage containers and many more. Waste management is devoted to the presentation and discussion of information on solid waste generation, characterization, minimization, collection, separation, treatment, and disposal, as well as manuscripts that address waste management policy, education, and economic and environmental assessments. There is a clear need for the current approach of waste disposal that is focused on municipalities and uses high energy/high technology, to move more towards waste processing and waste recycling, that involves public-private partnerships, aiming for eventual waste minimization - driven at the community level, and using low energy/low technology resources. Some of the defining criteria for future waste minimization programme will include deeper community participation, understanding economic benefits/recovery of waste, focusing on life cycles</p>

           <h3>Recycling and Reuse</h3>
           <p>As a nation, we are generating more garbage and we don't know what to do with it. Ineffctive or irresponsible disposal of this waste can pollute the environment and pose a public health risk. We are running out of space in existing landfills. Citizens are discovering that there is no easy way to get rid of the garbage they once assumed could be buried or burned and forgotten.
           Waste plastic materials are collected from various sources and segregated as per grade,colour and
           quality. The waste plastic materials are cleaned and washed with water before further processing. The
           cleaned plastic materials are put in a cutting machine and converted into small pieces. The cut pieces are
           put in an extru der where it is melted to give granule lumps. These lumps are put in grinding machine to
           obtain granules of required size and packed in 50 kgs. and 100 kgs.in bags for despatch to plastic
           processing units.
